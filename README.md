### Hi there 
My name is Katrin. I am a data scientist who approaches every project with passion, conscientiousness, and inclusiveness. I graduated with a M.S. in Applied Mathematics from Michigan State University in 2009. Since then, I have been teaching advanced mathematics and statistics at a high school and at a college level. I am currently studying data science at General Assemblyâ€™s Immersive program. 
<br> My M.S. in Applied Mathematics, combined with the skills learned at General Assemblyâ€™s Immersive Data Science program, gives me a strong ability to manipulate large data sets, identify patterns in raw data, and develop models to predict the likelihood of a future outcome and to optimize business solutions. I'm excited for the opportunity to turn data chaos into something meaningful and clear. 
<br> I thrive at work when I have ample opportunities for learning new skills and for taking on new responsibilities. I find satisfaction in collaboration, building relationships, and bringing joy to the team with a positive attitude and humor.
